# About
This is a translation to Typescript of [Squire]( https://neilj.github.io/Squire/ ) editor, to compensate for lack of some functions bugs were added.

This project is in a terrible state of business, incredibly early in its development and shouldn't be used by anyone.

# Usage
In /examples folder you'll find code as well as a README on how to use it on an Angular 4 project.
